## General Information
- A simple assignment on utilization of Advanced Regression.
- We use Python programming language for undertaking this task.
- We are intending to predict to predict the Sales' Price of the House on the basis of various parameters.
- The aim of the assignment is to leverage Hyperparameter tuning with the help of Ridge and Lasso regression techniques in order to develop a generalized model.



## Exploratory Data Analysis

- It has been observed that some of the variables are skewed and hence removed as part of feature elimination.
- Outliers have been removed.
- Ordinal variables have been re-engineered and numerical rank values have been assigned to them as part of feature engineering.
- Variable transformations have been carried out for strengthening of the model.


## Model Building

- RFE and manual feature elimination on the basis of p-values and VIF.
- Model evaluation using MLR.
- Model Evaluation using Ridge and Lasso Regressions (without RFE).


## Conclusions
- Clear demonstration of reduction in error difference between training and test data thereby eliminating Overfitting.





## Libraries Used
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for Visualization.
- Statsmodels and ScikitLearn for Analysis and Model Generation.
